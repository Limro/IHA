TI-ARDI

Dependable systems:
	A system, which is crucial and running on specific hardware. I.e. a pacemaker

Current systems:
	- Some lack QoS
	- A standard isn't implemented on all products

COTS:
	- Critical system has been build directly on the hardware for many years. This is not a good idea should hardware be changed.
	- Infrastructure Middleware was introduced to take care of the small layers
	- Distributed Middleware could now control multiple devices
	- Common Middleware service can handle the distributed
	- Domain specific services can handle specific services for certain units.

Avoid Monoliths:
	- One big file with everything in it
	- No architecture, no patterns
