\abstract{Ambient assisted living systems exists to give mostly elder people certainty, that alerts will be triggered e.g. should they fall in their homes, when wearing a fall detector.
To ensure the data from the fall detector is not a false-positive, a service can be created to plug into an existing system, analyzing other sensors' data to confirm/invalidate the detector's claim.
This article describes how such a service can be designed, plugged into an existing system, and provide a reliable analysis of incoming data.
A proof-of-concept application will be created to show the design is valid and fulfill the requirements of the objective.
Finally the article will elaborate on how proof-of-concept can be even better.}
