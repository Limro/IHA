\section*{Problem 1}
\textbf{Which of the  following sets are well-ordered? (Why/why not?)}
\begin{enumerate}[a]
\item $S=\{x \in \mathbb{Q}: x\geq -10\}$
\item[] $S$ is not well-ordered, since there is a subset which has no least number. A subset could be written as  $x=]10:\infty)$ 

\item $S=\{-2 ,-1, 0, 1, 2\}$
\item[] $S$ is well-ordered, since it is finite and and only with natural numbers which can be written as $S=[-2:2]$.


\item $S=\{x \in \mathbb{Q}: -1\leq x \leq 1\}$
\item[] $S$ is not well-ordered, since it is in $\mathbb{Q}$ and a subset can be written as $U=]-1,1[$ which means we have no least value when we can divide by a larger number to get an even smaller number.


\item $S=\{p :p \text{ is prime}\} = \{2, 3,5,7,9,11,13,\dots\}$
\item[] $S$ is well-ordered, since there is a lower limit for any subset.
\end{enumerate}



\section*{Problem 2}
\textbf{Use mathematical induction to prove that $1+5+9+\ldots+(4n-3)=2n^2-n$ for every positive integer $n$}.
\\
\\
\textbf{Base case} 
\\
$P(1)$ should be true:
\begin{align}
4n-3 &= 2n^2-n \\
4\cdot 1-3 &= 2\cdot 1^2-1 \\
1 &= 1 \label{equ:p2-1}
\end{align}
From (\ref{equ:p2-1}) we have shown the base case is in fact true.
\\
\\
\textbf{Induction step}
\\
The following should apply: $\forall k \in \mathbb{N}, P(k) \Rightarrow P(k+1)$
\begin{proof}
\begin{align}
1+5+9+\ldots+(4k-3) &= 2k^2-k & P(k)\\
1+5+9+\ldots+(4(k+1)-3) &= 2(k+1)^2-k+1 & P(k+1) \label{equ:2-2}\\
	&= 1+5+9+\ldots+\underbrace{(4k-3)}_{\mathclap{\text{Notice}}}+(4(k+1)-3) &\text{Then magic} \\
	&=(2k^2-k)+(4k+1)\\
	&=2k^2+3k+1\\
	&=2(k+1)^2-(k+1) 
\end{align}
\end{proof}
The result the same as (\ref{equ:2-2}) true and therefor follows the Principle of Mathematical Induction.


\section*{Problem 3}
\textbf{Prove that $2^n \geq n^3$ for every integer $n \geq 10$}.
%\\
%\\
%\textbf{Base case:}
%\\
%$P(10): 2^{10}\geq 10^3 \Leftrightarrow 1024 \geq 1000$ which is true.
%\\
%\\
%\textbf{Induction case:}
\begin{proof}
The inequality holds for $n=10$ since $2^{10} \geq 10^3 $. 
Assume that $2^k \geq k^3$, where $k$ is a nonnegative integer. We show that $2^{k+1} \geq (k+1)^3$. When $k=10$ , we have $2^{10} = 1024 \geq 1000 = 10^3$. We therefor assume that $k \geq 10$. Then
\begin{align}
2^{k+1} = 2\cdot 2^k &\geq k^3+3k^2+3k+1  \Leftrightarrow\\
2^k &\geq 3k^2+3k+1\\
	&\geq 
\end{align}
By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, $2^n \geq n^3$ for every integer $n \geq 10$.
\end{proof}





\section*{Problem 4}
\textbf{Use the method of minimum counterexample to prove that $3|\Big(2^{2n}-1\Big)$ for every positive integer \textit{n}}



\section*{Problem 5}
\textbf{Use the Strong Principle of Mathematical to prove the following.\\
Let $S= \{ i \in \mathbb{Z} : i \geq 2\}$ \\
and the $P$ be a subset of $S$ with the properties that $2,3 \in P$ \\
and if $n \in S$, then either $n \in P$ or $n=ab$, where $a,b\in S$. \\
Then every element of $S$ either belongs to $P$ or it can be expressed as a product of elements of $P$.}
\begin{proof}
The set, $S$, consist of only integers greater than 2 and $P$ is a subset of $S$.
Should $n$ be in the set $S$, it can be expressed as a product of two numbers in the subset, or it is in the subset it self.
\\
Case 1: $n$ is not a prime -- let's say 6. Here $n$ can be expressed as $2 \cdot 3 = 6$ and $n$ is therefor not in the subset, $P$.
\\
Case 2: $n$ is not a prime -- let's say 12. Here $n$ can be expressed as $3 \cdot 4 = 12$ and $n$ is not in the subset, but 4 is.
\\
Case 3: $n$ is a prime -- let's say 5. Here $n$ can not be expressed by the product of the elements in $P$ and is only the the set, $S$.
\\
With the cases we can see, that all elements of $S$ can be in the subset, $P$. 
Some elements of $S$ cannot be the product of elements in $P$ and must therefor be in the subset.
\end{proof}





\section*{Problem 6}
\textbf{Use the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction to prove, that for each integer $n\geq 12$, there are non-negative integers $a$ and $b$ such the $n=3a+7b$.}
