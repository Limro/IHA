\section*{Problem 3}

\paragraph{Please draw the encoder circuit.}
See sheet of paper.

\paragraph{Please complete the encoder state diagram shown in Figure 1}
See sheet of paper.

\paragraph{Find the HCF (highest common factor, i.e., GCD greatest common divisor) of its generator polynomials.}
The HCF is 1.


\paragraph{Is this encoder catastrophic or non-catastrophic?}
Non-catastrophic code is listed as a HCF with the form $D^I \in I \geq 0$ but since the HCF is not, which implies the code is catastrophic.
