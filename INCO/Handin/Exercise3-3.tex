\section*{Exercise 3.3}

A binary linear cyclic code $C_{cyc}(n, k)$ has code length $n = 7$ and generator polynomial $g(X) = 1 + X^2 + X^3 + X^4$.

\paragraph{(a) Find the code rate, the generator and parity check matrices of the code in
systematic form, and its minimum Hamming distance.}


\paragraph{(b) If all the information symbols are '1's, what is the corresponding code vector in its systematic form?}
