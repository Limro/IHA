Task descriptions as functional requirements

1. Main purpose:
- How to make Functional Requirement with system's context (which is forgotten)

2. Key questions:
- What is a good requirement


3. Most important information:
- The solution safes a lot of time and money

4. Main conclusions:
- The traditional approach required 10 times as much work because many stakeholders had to review
and comment on the proposals. The new approach also ensured that stakeholders received
the task support they needed or at least knew in advance what they would not receive.
