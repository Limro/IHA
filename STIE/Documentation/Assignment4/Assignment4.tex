The first play through  of the ME2 board game was interesting, since it was an undiscovered area it touched. 
This means it had the aspect of team play instead of the traditional "I must win" which put one in a new role compared to the assumption for the game.

It also had very long rounds to which the thought of D\&D games came to mind -- achieve an unknown goal along with your companions. 
Each of you posses a different set of skills and you progress by rolling multiple dices. 
And with this is mind the game represent a real life situation where you can't predict you  teammates moves anymore than you can convince them of what the better path towards the unclear goal is, each member having their own vision of how to achieve this.

The team selected a different set of personalities and skill sets for the game, decided on the area of wearable technology, created a plausible story and thought we could implement microbots into your bloodstream. 
This served the purpose of letting the two bioprocess engineers have some sort of relation to the subject while the two electro engineers and the undersigned, Computer engineer, could still contribute with the project.

As the game proceeded most of the group's member realized, that the idea of creating microbots was not for us and the game just had to end.
Even though we kept the time for the game, we didn't get very far as for the score went and the game kept punishing us for not having creative types in the group which we, by deign of the game, needed badly for making microbots.
With that in mind we feared what would happen in round two, when only engineers remained.

In the following lesson the term \textit{disharmony} was introduced and we did a 5 minutes brainstorm on what annoyed us doing the day, chose the wireless digital key approach and tried to fill out the \textit{Business Model}.
This took 3 tries, since the market shifted from literally 'everything with a lock' to 'only homecare helpers' to 'you got a door?'. 
To solve the problem we brainstormed on all plausible ways to get a door open without actually touching it, and rate every idea by different criteria, then weigh each criteria and sum the weighs for the most wanted solution. 
We thought of this as a splendid way of solving our problems, only slightly biased by the education of each member, and useful -- even though we ditch the idea and picked another as we did the Business Model rev. 3.
This was due to a few issues; our presentation revealed the population in general do not trust IT with screens, but have no problems with no-screen technology.

Practical thinking about how the user of the system would feel about take the phone from their pocket to a door and back was not ideal, nor was always active Bluetooth good for the battery.
Using a key with energy harvesting, 2 meters range and an intelligent encryption, the product would not meet a lot of resident on the market.
This is classic effectuation -- we know something, we know what we potential can do with it and we know where we change the goal of what we will do based on this.
