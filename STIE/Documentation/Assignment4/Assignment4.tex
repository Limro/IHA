The first play through  of the ME2 board game was interesting, since it was an undiscovered area it touched. 
This means it had the aspect of team play instead of the traditional "I must win" which put one in a new role compared to the assumption for the game.
It also had very long rounds to which the thought of D\&D games came to mind -- achieve an unknown goal along with your companions. 
Each of you posses a different set of skills and you progress by rolling multiple dices.
