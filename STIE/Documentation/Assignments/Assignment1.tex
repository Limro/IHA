I started on IHA in 2010, majoring ICT which includes the learning of software architecture, -building and -testing.
It mainly covers the .Net-family (C, C++ and C\#) but also SQL, VHDL and Java.

I am currently employed as a student software engineer in HSS Engineering (they sirens for Europe and the Middle East) developing a brand new system from scratch.
At my 5th semester I was an intern at d60 A/S co-developing an invoice system which did not work at all when I started, but could calculate, show and mail invoice to every customer in 3 clicks when I left.

When writing on computers your skills at the keyboard are pretty essential. 
Due to gaming activities, the need for shortcuts have come in handy working in different programs and in general the operating system Windows.
Aside from that I like to read books with rational characters -- the fan fiction \textit{Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality} or the fiction \textit{Worm} provides very good scenarios where you have to think.


\section{Who do you know?}
My network is quite limited to those people I like and those I respect.
Due to that my LinkedIn only contains people I have some work experience with or who have shown me their trading skills.
See Figure \ref{fig:network} for connections.

\section{Who am I as a person?}
According to a JTI test I took on my 4th semester I can be labeled as a ISTJ, and I doubt it has changed much (but we will see when the results are in).

When I finished my gymnasium I thought I should be a banker like my father, but quickly realized you talk way too much with people and the computer does all the calculations for you.
I wanted to do the calculations and since the Engineer High school had robots as well, I was sold.

I like robots, but I know nothing of the design of them (electronics) and I think low-level programming is harder than it should be (even though I extended the functionality of a drone during my bachelor project).
I like testing code and writing useful code people can use.
I like to show people what I can help them with and since I'm pretty handsome with LaTeX, I created some modules to load into a simple assignment or a thesis/bachelor/semester project.

I spend time on people who can give me something in return and try to ignore those who cannot. 
I like the objective approach to solving problems and steps in when is needed which is the reason I sit in the Board of Study.

I have a severe relation to people who harms other people -- directly or indirectly. 
This goes as well for people who feels like cheating the system.



\section{Why you are here at this course?}
Don't fool yourself -- it's mandatory for all with the System Engineers package.
\\
I think of entrepreneurship as a way for people in fine shirts, clicking shoes, too short hair and way too much energy toward other people, to find "business partners" (money) to realize a silly idea which will benefit someone in their network and they now have a way to sell it to others.
The people who invents new product I call -- inventors. 
The main difference be, that entrepreneurs think of money where as inventors think of a product.

I do most sincerely hope I am wrong, and you can change my view on this.
