Exam

- Up to 10 mins about the project
- How is the course used?
- How was the entire understanding of the project?
- BE EXTREMELY CONCRETE ON OWN PROJECT!
- What was your own role in the project

- 5-7 min on part 2
- Pick a number between 1-9
- Be more general



(1)
	- From needs to SRS
		- Specify operations
		- Transforming it
		"I need something" -> "This is how it should be done"

(2)
	- Trace the life cycle
	- What to do with the SRS afterwards
		- How to do it?
	- "house of qualities" - traceablillity matrix

(3)
	- How do management work (produce new version of documents and baseline)
	- What happen if something changes afterwards?
		- It can change in some ways
	- What parts can be used (and traced)
	- What will changes? Nails ex.

(4)
	- SysML and graphical notation for writing SRS
	- Easy to communicate
	- Simulated
	- Remember diagrams (not symbols, just conceptual)
	- E.g: take handin and show

(5)
	- How to decide (decicion management)
	- Explore design specs
		- Realize system in multiple ways - what to choose?
	- Should make it or not (could fail horriblely)
	- Draft the system and see if profit is possible
		- Don't bid if you can't
	- Consequences, business forms, people to use (diagram) ...

(6)
	- Start with requirement - what kind of engineering should be used? How do we get there?
	- Be aware of small parts needed in a system. Buy or build?
		- If neither buy of build then it cannot be done by you
	- Can it be done?
	- Does it fit the organization

(7)
	- Entire life cycle

(8)
	- Internal negociation
	- Make request for proposal
	- Make documents
	- SUBCONTRACTING!

(9)
	- Like software engineering in the real world
	- Hoover dam
	- Don't test in place
	- Test small parts
	- How to determin if the system can be used / verifyable / how to test it
	- Must be thought of very early
