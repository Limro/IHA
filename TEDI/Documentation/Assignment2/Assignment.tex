\section*{Part 1}
\paragraph{Model a client-server network that has peer-to-peer connections.
What is transmitted on the peer-to-peer connections should not be visible to clients and servers outside that connection.}

This is shown in \codeTitle \ref{lst:p2p}.
First we need to create a channel, \code{c}, which we can transmit through.
Then we create a proctype to send from, \code{Client1}, with its own channel, \code{transmitter}.
This channel is send through the first channel, \code{c}, to the proctype \code{Client2}, wait for it to receive the private channel and send the predefined information, \code{data}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Peer-to-peer network, style=Code-C, label=lst:p2p]
chan c = [1] of { byte }; 

active proctype Client1()
{
	byte data = 5;
	chan transmitter = [0] of { byte }; 
	c ! transmitter;
	transmitter ! data;
}

active proctype Client2()
{
	byte dataReceive = 0;
	chan receiver;

	c ? receiver;
	receiver ? dataReceive;
	
	assert( dataReceive == 5 );
}
\end{lstlisting}
This way we have created a peer-to-peer connection with a private channel.




\section*{Part 2}
\paragraph{Model a buffered channel by means of rendezvous channels.}

This is exactly what was done is the first part.
If anything else was wanted, please specify better.
