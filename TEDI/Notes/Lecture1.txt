Arbitrarily interleaving atomic statements
	- Process one does one thing, next process does something

Non-determinism
	- 2 statements from any 2 processes may or may not execute truly parallel.
	- Changing time will change concurrency processes
	- Distributed computer have their own time stamp. These must be send around or shared.
	- No common time must be send around
	- One cannot observe the system's GLOBALE state (all processes)
		- Only if you turn it off
	- Best to do is constructed images of state that may have existed

Channels
	- You can lose data because of different routing
	- Things can be reordered due to delay
